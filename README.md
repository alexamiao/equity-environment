⚖️ Equity & Environmental Analytics

This repository analyzes environmental inequities, focusing on how climate burdens (heat, pollution, flooding) disproportionately affect different socioeconomic and demographic groups.
Projects combine data science, spatial analysis, and social vulnerability indicators to quantify disparities and inform more equitable climate adaptation strategies.

---

🔎 Project Scope
- Heat exposure inequality across income and demographic groups  
- Environmental burden indices (pollution, heat, flood risk)  
- Statistical modeling of vulnerability & exposure  
- Population-weighted environmental metrics  
- Spatial clustering & regression (e.g., environmental justice studies)
